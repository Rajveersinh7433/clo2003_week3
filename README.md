Introduction: 
    Linux is an open-source and customizable software that manages system hardware and software resources. It is a kernel more like an operating system.

Section 1: Linux History: Linux was first released by Linus Torvalds in September 1991. Before that, the Unix OS was implemented in 1969 at AT&T's lab in the U.S and first released in 1971. 

Moreover, Due to improvements in scalability, reliability and security, the commericial use of Linus has been increasing day by day.

There are many popular Linux distributions such as  Debian, Fedora Linux, Arch Linux, and Ubuntu. Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise are commercial distributions.
